### Small learning project with deep learning models

#### 1. Predict machine CPU load

* Subject : Try to predict the cpu load of a machine with deep learning model

* Model used is a simple  **Embedding + Neural Network** model

* Sources :
    - [Entity embeddings of categorical variables (Cheng Guo and Felix Berkhahn)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.06737.pdf)
    - [Kaggle Rossmann Store Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/discussion/17974#101792)
    - [fast.ai Courses](http://course.fast.ai/lessons/lesson14.html)

* Use of Keras API with TensorFlow as backend

* To run the script : python predict.py [host]



#### 2. Predict image descriptors (Telecom ParisTech Challenge)

* Subject : Try to predict 128 descriptors from image 48 * 48

* Model used is a convolutional network

* Use of TensorFlow
